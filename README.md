This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, the business can better understand customer behaviors, preferences, and target marketing efforts more effectively.

Project Features:

Data Preprocessing:    Handling missing data, normalizing features, and preparing purchase history data for clustering.
Clustering with K-Means:    Using the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters based on their purchase patterns.
Elbow Method:    Implementing the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Data Visualization:    Plotting clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize customer segments and their characteristics.
Business Insights:    Deriving actionable insights from the clusters to aid in marketing, sales, and customer retention strategies.
